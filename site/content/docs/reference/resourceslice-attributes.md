description: NVIDIA GPU, MIG, and VFIO device attributes and capacity published by the DRA Driver for NVIDIA GPUs in ResourceSlices.
---

The DRA Driver for NVIDIA GPUs publishes each allocatable device — full GPUs, MIG
slices, and VFIO passthrough devices — as an entry under `spec.devices` in a
node's `ResourceSlice`. This page is a reference for the NVIDIA-specific
attributes and capacity on those entries: what each field means and the exact
names you reference in CEL selectors.

For the generic `ResourceSlice` type schema — every field on `ResourceSlice`,
`Device`, `DeviceAttribute`, `DeviceCapacity`, and related types — see the
[Kubernetes API reference for ResourceSlice v1](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/resource/resource-slice-v1/).
For how the driver publishes slices, see
[Publishing GPUs in ResourceSlices](../concepts/gpu-allocation.md#publishing-gpus-in-resourceslices).
To inspect the ResourceSlices on your own cluster, see
[View available GPU resources](../guides/gpu-allocation/view-resources.md).

## Device types

The DRA Driver for NVIDIA GPUs publishes all devices under a single driver,
`gpu.nvidia.com`, with one pool per node. The NVIDIA-specific `type` attribute on
each device identifies the kind of device, and the built-in DeviceClasses select
on it:

| `type` | DeviceClass | Device |
|---|---|---|
| `gpu` | `gpu.nvidia.com` | Full physical GPU |
| `mig` | `mig.nvidia.com` | MIG slice |
| `vfio` | `vfio.gpu.nvidia.com` | VFIO passthrough device |

The sections below show a representative `spec.devices[]` entry for each type.
`kubectl` prints map keys alphabetically (so `type` and `uuid` appear last), the
`#` comments are annotations rather than part of the real output, and the values
are illustrative — confirm them on your own cluster.

## Attribute naming: bare keys vs CEL domain

The same attribute has two naming forms. In the serialized `ResourceSlice`,
driver attributes appear as **bare keys** (`type`, `productName`, and so on)
because their domain is implied by the driver name. In a **CEL selector**, you
address them through that domain, `device.attributes['gpu.nvidia.com'].type`. The
standardized PCI attributes are the exception: they are stored fully qualified as
`resource.kubernetes.io/pciBusID` and `resource.kubernetes.io/pcieRoot`.

In selectors, attributes are read with
`device.attributes['gpu.nvidia.com'].<name>` and capacity with
`device.capacity['gpu.nvidia.com'].<name>`. For example, to match a GPU with more
than 40 GiB of memory:

```
device.capacity['gpu.nvidia.com'].memory.isGreaterThan(quantity("40Gi"))
```

For full selector examples, see
[Request full GPUs](../guides/gpu-allocation/allocating-gpus.md#select-a-gpu-by-product-name).
CEL-based device selection is a standard Kubernetes DRA feature; see the
[Kubernetes DRA documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/)
for the complete selector syntax.
