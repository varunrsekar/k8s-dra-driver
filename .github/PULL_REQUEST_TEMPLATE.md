Write "NONE" if there is no user-facing change.
Otherwise, describe the change for driver users / cluster admins. Examples:

- changes to DeviceClass, ResourceClaim, or CRD shapes
- behavior changes for MIG, time-slicing, IMEX, or sharing modes
- deployment/Helm chart changes (values, defaults, RBAC)

#### Additional documentation (design docs, usage docs, etc.):

<!--
Link any supporting docs, e.g.:
- updates under docs/ (design, MIG, IMEX, sharing, etc.)
- README or demo/ updates
- related KEPs in kubernetes/enhancements
Use permalinks (commit SHA) rather than branch links so references stay stable.

#### Checklist

<!-- Tick what applies; leave others unchecked. CI re-runs some of these, but catching them locally shortens the review loop. -->
- [ ] `make check test` passes locally
- [ ] `make generate` re-run if `api/` changed (CRDs, deepcopy, informers, listers, clientset)
- [ ] `make vendor` re-run if `go.mod` / `go.sum` changed

- [ ] Helm chart (`deployments/helm`) updated if flags, RBAC, or defaults changed
