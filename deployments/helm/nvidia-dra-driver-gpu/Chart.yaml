# Note(JP): strict semver: no v prefix allowed
version: "25.3.0-rc.2"

# Note(JP): templating logic consumes `appVersion` for building the default
# `tag` value used in a k8s image specification. That logic expects the version
# number below to not have a "v" prefix (a "v" is added by said logic to yield a
# valid image reference).
